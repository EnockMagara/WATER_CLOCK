    <h1>Project Documentation: Multi-Drop Time Clock</h1>

    <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Multi-Drop Time Clock is a web-based application designed to visually represent the passage of time through a unique droplet interface. The project incorporates tooltips to provide real-time feedback on seconds, minutes, and hours, enhancing user interaction and engagement.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>The inspiration for this project came from a desire to create a visually appealing and interactive way to represent time.The idea was to use droplets as a metaphor for time flowing, making the experience more engaging. The use of tooltips adds an informative layer, allowing users to see the exact time represented by each droplet.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Initial Conceptualization</h3>
                <p>Brainstormed ideas for a time representation that diverged from conventional designs. Decided on using droplets to symbolize the flow of time, with each droplet representing seconds, minutes, and hours.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Design and Layout</h3>
                <p>Created a layout using HTML and CSS, focusing on a clean and modern aesthetic. Utilized Flexbox for responsive design, ensuring the application would look good on both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Functionality Implementation</h3>
                <p>Developed the core functionality using JavaScript, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Real-time updates of the droplet heights based on the current time.</li>
                    <li>Tooltips that display the current time when hovering over the respective containers.</li>
                    <li>Implemented sound effects to enhance user experience, playing sounds at specific time intervals.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Ensuring the layout worked seamlessly across different screen sizes was challenging. Flexbox helped, but additional media queries were necessary for fine-tuning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tooltip Visibility:</strong> Initially, the tooltips were designed to show on hover, which posed a challenge on mobile devices where hover effects do not exist. This required a shift to tap events for mobile compatibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sound Implementation:</strong> Managing sound playback at specific intervals while ensuring it did not interfere with the user experience required careful timing and logic.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>User Experience Enhancements</h3>
                <p>Added animations for the tooltips to create a smoother user experience. Ensured that the tooltips were positioned at the top of the screen for better visibility, especially on mobile devices.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Final Touches</h3>
                <p>Incorporated the Roboto font for a modern look, enhancing the overall aesthetic of the application. Conducted testing across various devices to ensure functionality and responsiveness.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
